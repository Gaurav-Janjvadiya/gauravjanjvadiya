          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I started coding during my 12th vacation and have since developed a
            strong background in the MERN stack. I am currently pursuing a
            Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at Junagadh Gurukul. My
            journey in web development began with a fascination for how web
            technologies work and has evolved into a deep passion for creating
            engaging and user-friendly applications.
